Build your bot

# Testing locally

Play full games on your machine with the same engine the tournament runs, and A/B your own versions.

The `macpoker` CLI plays full games on your machine using the same engine the tournament runs, in the same duplicate format: one game per seat over the same decks, every bot shifted one seat each game, and a fresh instance of every bot for each game.

## Play a game

``` sh
macpoker play main.py house:call house:random --deals 50
```

Terminal window

Every argument after `play` is one **seat** at the table. Pass 2 to 9 seats in any mix of:

- a path to one of your bot files: `main.py`, `v2.py`, `../old/bot.py`
- a built-in house bot, written with the `house:` prefix

| House bot | Style |
|----|----|
| `house:call` | Calls everything, never raises. The validation opponent. |
| `house:checkfold` | Checks when free, folds to any bet. |
| `house:allin` | Shoves every chance it gets. |
| `house:random` | Mixes calls, folds and odd raises. |

## Options

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `--deals N` | 50 | Hands per game, each from a fresh deck. |
| `--games N` | one per seat | Games in the set. Fewer than one per seat leaves the cards unbalanced. |
| `--seed S` | `local` | Deck seed. Same seed, same cards. |
| `--stack N` | 200 | Starting stack each hand (blinds are 1 and 2). |
| `--time-ms N` | 30000 | Starting time bank per bot. |
| `--increment-ms N` | 100 | Clock increment per hand. |
| `--subprocess` | off | Run bots as separate processes over the real wire protocol. |
| `--history FILE` | off | Write the full hand history as JSON. |

## Comparing your own bots

Any seat can be one of your files, and you can pass several at once:

``` sh
macpoker play v1.py v2.py aggressive.py house:call --deals 100 --seed fight
```

Terminal window

Because every bot plays every deck from every seat over the set, all of your variants play the same cards from the same positions. The final chip totals are a fair head-to-head comparison, not deck luck. Keep old versions around (`v1.py`, `v2.py`, …) and A/B them: pin `--seed` while you iterate so runs repeat exactly, then change the seed to confirm an improvement holds up.

A bot can also play its own copy:

``` sh
macpoker play main.py main.py --deals 200
```

Terminal window

Each seat gets an independent instance, and self-play should net close to zero. A large swing means your bot behaves inconsistently between positions.

## Reading the result

``` text
100 hands (2 games x 50 hands, same decks, seats shifted each game)
bot                                chips    mbb/hand  verdict
main.py                             +140       700.0  OK
house:call                          -140      -700.0  OK
```

Output

Chips is the score. `mbb/hand` is milli-big-blinds per hand, a rate that is comparable across game lengths. Chips and `mbb/hand` are totals over the whole set. A verdict other than `OK` names the game it happened in and means your bot stopped playing for the rest of that game: see [clocks and verdicts](/game-format/clocks/).

## Debugging

- `print()` from your bot goes to stderr and is shown after the game if it had problems.
- `--subprocess` catches an entire class of bugs (protocol misuse, crashes on startup, slow imports) exactly as the tournament would.
- `--seed` makes runs reproducible while you iterate.
