Build your bot

# Writing a bot

Everything your bot can see and do: the decision method, every field on state and the observer hooks.

Your submission is a zip with a `main.py` at its root. `main.py` defines exactly one `Bot` subclass (or a module-level `bot = MyBot()` instance). You may split code into other modules in the zip and import them from `main.py`.

``` python
from macpoker import Bot

class MyBot(Bot):
    def act(self, state):
        ...
        return state.call()
```

main.py

## The decision method

`act(state)` is called every time it is your turn. It must return an action before your [clock](/game-format/clocks/) runs out.

### Actions

| Return | Meaning |
|----|----|
| `state.check()` | Pass the action. Only legal when `state.to_call == 0`. |
| `state.call()` | Match the current bet (`state.to_call` chips). |
| `state.fold()` | Give up the hand. |
| `state.raise_to(n)` | Raise so your total bet this street becomes `n`. |
| `state.all_in()` | Raise to `state.max_raise_to`. |

Illegal actions are coerced to the nearest legal action rather than punished: an impossible raise becomes a call, checking a bet folds, and out-of-range raise amounts are clamped. Rely on the fields below instead of the coercion.

## GameState reference

### Your cards and the table

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `state.hole` | `list[str]` | Your two cards, e.g. `["As", "Td"]`. Ranks `2..9 T J Q K A`, suits `s h d c`. |
| `state.board` | `list[str]` | Community cards dealt so far (0, 3, 4 or 5). |
| `state.street` | `str` | `"preflop"`, `"flop"`, `"turn"` or `"river"`. |
| `state.hand` | `int` | Hand number within the game. |
| `state.seat` | `int` | Your seat index this hand. |
| `state.button` | `int` | Seat of the dealer button. |

### Chips

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `state.pot` | `int` | All chips committed to the pot so far. |
| `state.to_call` | `int` | Chips you must add to stay in. `0` means you may check. |
| `state.min_raise_to` | `int` | Smallest legal raise-to total. |
| `state.max_raise_to` | `int` | Raise-to total that puts you all in. |
| `state.can_raise` | `bool` | Whether raising is legal for you right now. |
| `state.stacks` | `list[int]` | Remaining chips per seat. |
| `state.street_bets` | `list[int]` | Chips each seat has bet on this street. |
| `state.my_stack` | `int` | Shorthand for `state.stacks[state.seat]`. |

### Everyone else

| Field | Type | Meaning |
|----|----|----|
| `state.players` | `list[int]` | Player id in each seat this hand. Ids stay fixed for the whole game. |
| `state.player` | `int` | Your own player id. |
| `state.player_at(seat)` | `int` | Player id sitting in `seat`. |
| `state.seat_of(player)` | `int` | Seat a player is in this hand. |
| `state.folded` | `list[bool]` | Which seats have folded this hand. |
| `state.num_players` | `int` | Seats at the table. |
| `state.players_in_hand` | `int` | Seats not folded. |
| `state.history` | `list` | Every action this hand: `[street, seat, kind, amount]`. |
| `state.clock_ms` | `int` | Milliseconds left on your clock. |

There is no equity calculator and no pot-odds helper. Working out the maths is your job; that is the tournament.

## Observing the game

Beyond `act`, you may override optional hooks. All are silent no-ops by default:

``` python
class MyBot(Bot):
    def on_match_start(self, info): ...   # game config, blinds, clocks
    def on_hand_start(self, info): ...    # your seat and hole cards
    def on_action(self, event): ...       # every action by every seat
    def on_street(self, event): ...       # board reveals
    def on_hand_end(self, info): ...      # results, revealed cards, pots
    def on_match_end(self, info): ...     # final chip totals
```

Every event also carries `players` (seat to player id), so you can key what you learn by player id. Seats move every hand, but player ids stay fixed for the whole game:

``` python
from collections import defaultdict

class MyBot(Bot):
    def __init__(self):
        self.raises = defaultdict(int)

    def on_action(self, event):
        who = event["players"][event["seat"]]
        if event["action"] == "raise":
            self.raises[who] += 1
```

Keep state between hands on `self`. Each game runs your bot as one process, so `self` persists for the whole game and resets between games.

## Printing

`print()` is safe: stdout is redirected to the game log, which you can read in the app when a validation game finishes. Do not try to write to the protocol stream yourself.
