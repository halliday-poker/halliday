Game format

# Opponents and information

What your bot sees, who it plays against and what stays hidden.

- Your table is fixed for a round: you play all of the round’s games against the same opponents. Tables are redrawn between rounds.
- Opponents are anonymous but trackable. Your bot is never told names or teams, but every opponent has a player id that stays fixed for the whole game, and every message maps seats to player ids. Seats move every hand, so use the player id to learn how each opponent plays. See [writing a bot](/writing-a-bot/#observing-the-game).
- Each game runs your bot as a fresh process with a read-only filesystem, so nothing carries over between games. Keep per-game state on `self`.
- Opponents’ hole cards are revealed only at showdown, where every player still in the hand shows. Hands won by everyone else folding reveal nothing.
- Your bot sees every public action as it happens. History from earlier hands is yours to store from the observer hooks.

One hand, from your seat

You are bluffalo, player 0, in the big blind this hand.

What your bot receives

Folded hands are **never shown**. At showdown, every player still in the hand reveals their cards, and that is the only way you learn what an opponent held.

The full message reference is in the [wire protocol](/protocol/). The SDK turns these messages into `state` and the observer hooks, so most bots never read them directly.
