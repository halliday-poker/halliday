Game format

# Duplicate deals

Every bot plays every hand from every seat, so the deck never decides a result.

Card luck is engineered out across each round. Every table plays one game per seat, and all of a table’s games deal the same 100 hands. Each game shifts every bot one seat along, so by the end of the round every bot has played every hand from every seat, exactly as its opponents did. What separates scores is decisions, not the deck.

One table, one round

Pick a game, then step through its hands.

Hand · fresh deck

Who held what in hand , game by game

Every row ends up holding **all five sets of cards** from **all five positions**, once each. Within a game every hand is a new deck, so no bot ever sees the same cards twice.

## How a round is dealt

- A table of 5 plays 5 games, a table of 4 plays 4, and a table of 6 plays 6.
- Within a game, every hand is dealt from a new deck and the button moves one seat each hand.
- Hand 1 of every game at the table uses the same deck, as does hand 2, and so on. Game 2 starts every bot one seat further round than game 1.
- Each game runs your bot as a new process, so it starts every game knowing nothing about the others.

Running `macpoker play` locally deals the same way, so two versions of your bot get a fair comparison on your machine too. See [testing locally](/local-testing/).
