# Rules

What every team agrees to by entering. Breaking a rule disqualifies the team.

## Teams

- Teams have 1 to 4 members, and each person belongs to one team.
- Every member holds their own ticket for the event.

## Building your bot

- All bot code is written during the 48-hour hackathon. Nothing is written beforehand.
- Submissions use the provided template: a zip with `main.py` at its root.
- Python standard library plus numpy only.
- AI tools are allowed for development: writing code, debugging and brainstorming. They are not allowed at runtime. Your bot’s decisions come from code your team wrote, not from a call to an AI model or any other service during a game.

## During a game

- **No network access** of any kind. The sandbox has none.
- **Compute only on your own turn.** Your bot works inside `act()` and the observer hooks, and nowhere else. No background threads, no extra processes, and no work scheduled to run while opponents are acting.
- **No teaming.** Your bot plays for itself alone. It must not recognise, signal to, soft-play or pass chips to another team’s bot, and teams must not agree on strategies that help each other.
- **No interference.** Do not try to read anything outside your own bot, exhaust shared resources, or recover hidden information such as unseen cards or the deck order by any means other than playing the game.

## Review

Every final submission is read by the organisers before the tournament runs, for code quality and for compliance with these rules. A submission that breaks a rule is removed from the tournament and the team is disqualified. The organisers’ decision is final.
